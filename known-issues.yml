zib-MedicationAgreement:
  zib deviations:
    MedicationRequest.note.text:
      - cardinality:  1..1
        reason: The text element makes the value required (1..1), but the use of the note itself is optional (0..1), effectively resulting a cardinality of 0..1 for this element.
    MedicationRequest.extension:additionalInformation.value[x]:
      - cardinality:  0..1
        reason: The used extension allows the value to occure only once (0..1), but the use of the extension itself is allowed to be repeated (0..*), effectively resulting a cardinality of 0..* for this element.
    MedicationRequest.dosageInstruction:
      - cardinality:  0..*
        reason: DosageInstructions is profiled on a datatype level (Dosage) and not a resource. In FHIR the root concepts of InstructionsForUse do not all extist in the Dosage datatype. These are represented in the resource that includes the Dosage information. Therefore, the cardinality needs to be 0..* because the zib container DosageInstruction within InstructionsForUse is also 0..*. 
      - datatype: Dosage
        reason: DosageInstructions in FHIR is represented using the Dosage datatype, not as a separate resource.
        
ext-MedicationAgreement.AdditionalInformation:
  zib deviations:
    Extension.value[x]:
      - cardinality:  0..1
        reason: The  extension allows the value to occure only once (0..1), but the use of the extension itself (in a resource)is allowed to be repeated (0..*), effectively resulting a cardinality of 0..* for this element.
