# FunctionalOrMentalStatus
Zib FunctionalOrMentalStatus provides a common model for both functional and mental status observations. The zib can use either a simple statement about a limitation (zib concept StatusName), or a combination of what is being observed and how it impacts the patient (StatusName in conjunction with StatusValue).

In FHIR, instances of this zib are mapped onto the Observation resource, with StatusName mapped onto `Observation.code` and StatusValue onto `Observation.valueCodeableConcept`. As `Observation.code` contains details about the functional or mental parameter being observed, `Observation.category` is used to indicate that his is an observation about a functional or mental status (i.e. an instance of the zib).

However, functional statuses and mental statuses are unrelated concepts in SNOMED. Therefore, no common category code exists to indicate a "functional or mental status". As a result, functional status Observations should be categorized differently than mental status Observations (using SNOMED 118228005 versus SNOMED 384821006). In the profile, this is indicated using the slices `.category:functionalStatusFinding` and `.category:mentalStatusFinding`. It is up to the sending system and assign one of these codes to the `.category`. More information can be found in [zib ticket ZIB-1549](https://nictiz.atlassian.net/browse/ZIB-1549).
