  <description value="A nursing intervention is the care and/or treatment carried out by a nurse based on an expert opinion and clinical knowledge. It is part of the nursing process; interventions are determined as a result of indexed healthcare problems (nursing diagnoses) and based on treatment goals. Following the NEN-EN-ISO 18104 norm, it is possible to structure nursing interventions (or actions) in a hierarchy, where one intervention can be part of another intervention.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a home care situation some actions can also be performed by the patient or a caregiver after a relevant instruction." />
