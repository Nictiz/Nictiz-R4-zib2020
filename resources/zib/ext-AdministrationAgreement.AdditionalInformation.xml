    <description value="An extension to provide additional information that includes details on the structure of the agreement made. This element mainly contains information that until now has been structured with ZZ rules. The medication-related topics that are now supported by the ZZ rules are best supported with a system functionality. A process has been started for this by Z-index/KNMP. For now, the following list will be used. This list will be replaced by a thesaurus in the G standard at a later stage." />
