These concepts are in the zib placed on the same level as DosingInstructions, but are in FHIR part of the Dosage datatype. As a consequence, these zib concepts may be duplicated if this Dosage profile is instantiated multiple times.&#xA;&#xA;This profile should be used in medication related resources that define dosage instructions and supplemented by the extensions [ext-RenderedDosageInstruction](http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/ext-RenderedDosageInstruction) and [ext-InstructionsForUse.RepeatPeriodCyclicalSchedule](http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/ext-InstructionsForUse.RepeatPeriodCyclicalSchedule) to implement the remaining zib concepts Description and RepeatPeriodCyclicalSchedule." />
