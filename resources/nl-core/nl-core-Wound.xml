  <description value="A wound is an interruption of the continuity of the skin, often caused by external influences.&#xD;&#xA;A commonly used model for documenting the wound properties is the TIME (‘Tissue’, ‘Infection’, ‘Moisture’, ‘Edge’) model, which can be used to systematically describe the wound. For wound tissue (T in the TIME model), the structure of the WCS model (Woundcare Consultant Society, WCS Kenniscentrum Wondzorg) is used. The WCS model is not suited for describing oncological ulcers. There is a separate classification for that.&#xD;&#xA;Oncological ulcers are skin defects which result from the tumor process. They are different from wounds resulting from cancer treatment, such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy or surgery.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The concept does not describe decubitus wounds and burn wounds. For these, the relevant information models can be used." />
