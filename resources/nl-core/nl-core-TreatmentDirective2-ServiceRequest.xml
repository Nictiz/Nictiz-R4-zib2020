  <description value="A treatment directive contains a joint decision between a health professional (for example a general practitioner) and a patient or his representative(s) about the desirability of performing a certain treatment, such as resuscitation, before this treatment becomes (acute) necessary.&amp;#xD;&amp;#xA;When the need arises and the treatment cannot be discussed with the patient or representative (s), that decision is an important indication for the treating health professional (for example an ER doctor).&amp;#xD;&amp;#xA;The term treatment limit is a synonym of the term treatment directive." />

      <comment value="At the time of writing, there is no obvious way to represent treatment directives in FHIR. The Consent states that they are in scope, but not yet modeled in FHIR R4. Meanwhile there is [discussion in the FHIR community](https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-50903) if the ServiceRequest would be a better fit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For this reason, zib TreatmentDirective2 if mapped onto both the ServiceRequest and the Consent resource:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* This ServiceRequest resource should be regarded the actionable resource. It covers the decision to perform or not perform a specific treatment, and information if this decision is still active.&#xD;&#xA;* The [Consent resource](http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-TreatmentDirective2-Consent) is the resource containing the details of the agreement. It duplicates the information that is also present in this ServiceRequest. The Consent resource can be referenced from `ServiceRequest.supportingInfo`." />
