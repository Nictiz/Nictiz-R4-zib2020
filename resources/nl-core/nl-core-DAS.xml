  <description value="The Disease Activity Score (DAS) is a combined index developed in Nijmegen around 1990 to measure disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It concerns a formula with 28 or 44 painful and swollen joints, a blood value for inflammation (BSE or CRP) and the overall experience of disease activity by the patient. The DAS results in a number between 0 and 10, which indicates how active rheumatoid arthritis is at present. The score has been validated for use in clinical trials in combination with the EULAR response criteria." />
