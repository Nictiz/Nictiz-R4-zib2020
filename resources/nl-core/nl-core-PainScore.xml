  <description value="The pain score is a general measurement for pain experience, not a description of specific, localized pain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The following are used as an easily reproducible measurement for pain experience:&#xD;&#xA;NRS (Numeric Rating Scale) in which the patient gives the pain a number on a scale of 1 (no pain) to 10 (unbearable pain).&#xD;&#xA;VAS (Visual Analogue Score), in which the patient points to a bar with a line to indicate the pain they feel. The back of the bar has a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (unbearable pain) on it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The results of both scores have the same meaning, but the visual analogue method (VAS) is seen as more reliable than the NRS pain score." />
