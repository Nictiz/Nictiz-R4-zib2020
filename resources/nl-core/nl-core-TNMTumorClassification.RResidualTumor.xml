  <description value="TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors (TNM) is the cancer staging system developed and is maintained by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC). It is also used by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). In 1987, the UICC and AJCC staging systems were unified into the single TNM staging system. Nevertheless, there are still some differences between the two systems.&#xD;&#xA;The TNM-classification is developed for solid tumors. TNM is a notation system that describes the stage of a cancer, which originates from a solid tumor, using alphanumeric codes; T describes the size of the original (primary) tumor and whether it has invaded nearby tissue, N describes nearby (regional) lymph nodes that are involved, and M describes distant metastasis (spread of cancer from one part of the body to another). In addition to T, N and M, the classification also contains other parameters that may be relevant." />
