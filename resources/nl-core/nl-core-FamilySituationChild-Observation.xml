  <description value="Traditionally, a family is defined as a group of people of one or more adults who carry responsibility for caring for and raising one or more children.&#xD;&#xA;Children can have multiple family situations when they live partly with their father and partly with their mother e.g. after a divorce.&#xD;&#xA;Currently, the term is used more broadly for all forms of cohabitation which form a recognizable social unit, of people who are or who are not related and who have long-lasting, affective bonds and provide each other with support and care."/>
