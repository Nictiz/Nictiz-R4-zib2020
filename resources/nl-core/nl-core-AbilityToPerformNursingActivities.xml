  <description value="When taking care of a patient with a disease or disability, parents, children and other caretakers often carry out nursing interventions. Adults and older children may carry out nursing interventions by themselves. Therefore skills training is needed for caregivers/ children. Qualification is required for correct performing of an intervention and also knowledge about what to do in case of complications.&#xD;&#xA;The assessment of the degree to which the intervention can be performed independently refers only to the indicated intervention." />
