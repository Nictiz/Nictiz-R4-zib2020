  <description value="A stoma is an unnatural, surgically created opening connecting a body cavity with the outside world. A stoma is created e.g. as an exit opening for feces or urine in the event that they cannot leave the body naturally. In the case of a tracheostomy, the stoma is intended to facilitate breathing if that is no longer possible via the oral, nasal and throat cavity." />
  <purpose value="A derived profile from [zib-Stoma](http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-Stoma) to provide a version better suited for implementation purposes. This profile augments the base profile with elements found in the various use cases that have adopted the zib." />

      <comment value="Please note that on a functional level, zib Stoma references zib MedicalDevice, but in FHIR this direction is reversed. Therefore, the concept StomaMaterial (NL-CM:5.2.3) is mapped on `DeviceUseStatement.reasonReference` in profile [nl-core-MedicalDevice](http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-MedicalDevice) instead of in this profile." />
