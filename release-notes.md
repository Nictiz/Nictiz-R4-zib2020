# Nictiz-R4-Zib2020 Release Notes

This document contains release notes per zib, indicating differences with their [STU3 versions](https://simplifier.net/packages/nictiz.fhir.nl.stu3.zib2017/), deviations from the [profiling guidelines](https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/FHIR:V1.0_FHIR_Profiling_Guidelines_R4) and other points of interest.

## zib-AddressInformation
* Added extra comments on the history of the mapping in relation to v3.
* Removed mapping to BRP.
* Added guidance on adding a value to `Address.line` to duplicate the relevant information in case the extensions are not supported.
* Renamed `Address.line` extensions to their functional counterparts.
* Added a comment to `line.extension:houseNumberLetter-houseNumberAddition` on the possibility of a leading space not being parsed.
* Added a constraint to `line.extension:houseNumberIndication` to restrict it to the values 'by' or 'to'.
* Mapped AddressType to `extension:addressType` and added ConceptMaps to map AddressType to `.use` and `.type` to adhere to international use. However, `extension:official` was removed. AddressType code 'HP' is now mapped to `.use` 'home' and `.type` 'both'. This was done because of two reasons:
 * The notion to mark an address as 'official' seems to have its origin in the BRP, but is absent in the zib model.
 * The addition of `extension:official` seemed based on the rationale: "if implementers do not support the custom `extension:addressType`, you should be able to determine the AddressType by looking at `.use`, `.type` and custom `extension:official`". However, in this use case extension:official would probably also be not supported. By mapping 'HP' to .type 'both', all AddressType codes can be mapped to a combination of .type and .use.
 
## zib-AlcoholUse
* The code on `Observation.component:amount.code` has changed to 897148007

## zib-Alert
* Renamed `extension:ConcernReference` to `extension:concern` to match its functional counterpart.
* Added EndDateTime and Comment concepts
* Added constraints in the profile on the choice that the zib provides between Concern and AlertName. Add guidance on which code to add to Flag.code if a reference to Concern is added.

## zib-AdvanceDirective
* Moved TypeOfLivingWill from `Consent.category` to `Consent.provision.code`, renamed it to LivingWillType in accordance with the zib and made the element 0..1 rather than 1..1 to adhere to the conceptual cardinalities of the zib.
* Moved LivingWillDocument from `Consent.source[x]` to `Consent.source[x]:sourceAttachment.data`.
* Moved Representative from `Consent.consentingParty` to `Consent.provision.actor:representative.reference` because the element is removed in R4. Also `Consent.provision.actor:representative.role` has now a fixed value for this mapping.
* Replaced fixed zib code 11341000146107#http://snomed.info/sct on `Consent.category` with acd#http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/consentcategorycodes because this is an applicable code bound in the extensible ValueSet.
* Removed references that are not defined by the zib (e.g. `Consent.organization` and `Consent.actor`).
* Adjusted the `Consent.dateTime` cardinality from 1..1 to 0..1 to adhere to the conceptual cardinalities of the zib.
* Added guidance for mandatory elements `Consent.status`,`Consent.scope` and `Consent.policy` or `Consent.policyRule`.

## zib-AnatomicalLocation
* New partial zib. The anatomical location in FHIR is usually mapped on `.bodySite` (CodeableConcept with example binding). This zib has therefore been mapped onto a data type profile that can be used for `.bodySite`.

## zib-CareTeam
* CareTeam is a newly added zib in the 2020 release. It has no previous profile and therefore no diff.

## zib-ContactInformation
* zib ContactInformation is mapped onto two profiles: one for the concept TelephoneNumbers and one for the concept E-mailAddresses. Both are added to the hosting profile.
* Removed mapping guidance on the root comment of zib-ContactInformation-E-mailAddresses, as this is now straightforward.
* Simplified mapping guidance on the root comment of zib-ContactInformation-TelephoneNumbers, as this is now straightforward.
* `ContactPoint.system` has a fixed value for zib-ContactInformation-E-mailAddresses and a restricted ValueSet for zib-ContactInformation-TelephoneNumbers to implement only the relevant zib parts.
* `ContactPoint.use` has a restricted ValueSet in both profiles to implement only the relevant zib parts.
* The extension zib-ContactInformation-TelecomType, which replaced the generic code-specification extensions from release 2.x of the zib2017 package onwards, has been deprecated again in favor of code-specication, as the mapping is now much more straightforward.
* The element TelephoneNumbers/Comment was introduced. This is represented using the ext-Comment extension in the profile for TelephoneNumbers.

## zib-ContactPerson
* Added textual guidance on the root to guide usage of RelatedPerson versus Patient.
* Removed the role extension (http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-relatedperson-role) because `RelatedPerson.relationship` has changed from 0..1 to 0..*. The zib concept role is now mapped to a slice on relationship.
* Updated to new zib-NameInformation, zib-AddressInformation and zib-ContactInformation profiles.

## zib-DrugUse
* The drugUseCode is mapped to `Observation.code` and based on a pattern
* The code on `Observation.component:drugOrMedicationType.code` has changed to 105590001
* The code on `Observation.component:amount.code` has changed to 363908000

## zib-EpisodeOfCare
* New zib in 2020. However, in the zib2017 package the nl-core-episodeofcare profile exists, which is not based on a zib but included some use case concepts. This zib profile supersedes this profile.
* The extension EpisodOfCare-Title has been replaced by ext-EpisodeOfCare.EpisodeOfCareName because this zib concept is functionally equivalent.
* The extensions EpisodeOfCare-DateFirstEncounter and EpisodeOfCare-DateLastEncounter from the previous profile are not inherited because no functional backing exists.

## zib-HealthcareProvider
* `Organization.identifier` is now sliced based on a pattern.
* `Organization.type[DepartmentSpecialty]` and `Organization.type[OrganizationType]` from 0..* to 0..1.
* For `Organization.type` the slicing discriminator is changed from fixed system values to valueset binding.
* Removed comments on `Organization.alias` because it has no basis in the zib.
* Added comments on the root to point out to the usage of Location resource and the `Organization.partOf`.
* Major change: use of Location resource.

## zib-HealthProfessional
* `Practitioner.identifier` slices changed cardinality from 0..1 to 0..*.
* Added HealthProfessionalIdentificationNumber mapping on `PracititionerRole.identifier`.
* Added new mapping of Gender in Practitioner.
* Added textual guidance on the root to clarify the use of Practitioner and PractitionerRole.
* Added textual guidance on the root of the concept of HealthProfessionalRole.
* `PractitionerRole.specialty` is not sliced anymore but has a combined ValueSet.
* Explained cardinality mismatch of `Practitioner.name` on that element.

## zib-LivingSituation
* Added two new concepts and modelled them on `Observation.component:homeAdaption` and `Observation.component:livingCondition`.
* Concept 'HouseType' has been moved to its own valueCodeableConcept slice.
* The comment element has been moved to `Observation.note.text`.

## zib-NameInformation
* The way this partial zib has been modelled on the HumanName datatype has been overhauled to properly accommodate the way first names are handled. In the STU3 version, official first names, initials of this first name, and the given name (nickname, roepnaam) were all added to a `.given` element in the same HumanName instance, with a annotation of the type using an extension. This turned out to be the wrong approach, as all `.given` names are to be concatenated to the complete list of first names. So instead, there are now different instances of HumanName used to communicate the official names and the given name, indicated by `.use` -- resulting in two profiles. Communicating initials is now only done for names where the full name is not known (this deviates from the zib model).   
* `.use` has been made mandatory (instead of discouraged).
* Moved information and mappings from the extension level to the `value[x]` level.
* `.family.extension`'s now have the zib concept names as slice names instead of the extension names.
* The `.given.extension` slice name has been changed to indicate that it is only about full name or initial. 
* Added mappings for the newly added zib concept 'titels' on `prefix` and `suffix`. Added documentation/implementation guidance on `prefix` and the root.
* Removed copied FHIR definitions and comments as these originated from DSTU2 and are given in the base data type. Moreover, this increases the focus on our added comments. 
* Removed explanation of splitting up family names, as this is already given by the zib.
* Aliases has been aligned with the zib.
* Removed BRP mappings.
* Added the notion on the root that populating `HumanName.text` is encouraged.

## zib-NursingIntervention
* The resource to represent this zib has been changed from Procedure to CarePlan. This aligns better with the meaning of the zib: a statement of a plan (which may or not may have been completed) rather than the record of a procedure that has been carried out. The profile for the current version is created from scratch.
* Because there's a better match with CarePlan, the five custom extensions are removed. One custom extension is added to mark a `CarePlan.contributor` as the zib Requester, and another one to define the materials used.
* Note: although the zib has changed quite dramatically since release 2017, the previous version of the profile was based on a pre-adopt of zib pre-release 2018, which is the same as release 2020.

## zib-Patient
* Includes Nationality, MaritalStatus, LanguageProficiency.
* Cardinality of `Patient.extension:nationality` left at 0..* due to the nature of the nationality core extension (which allows for a period to be placed next to the nationality and thus allows for different nationalities over time).
* Cardinality of `Patient.name` left at 0..* to allow including several name elements with a different `name.use` each.
* Cardinality of `Patient.telecom` left at 0..* to allow including several contact elements, because the zib ContactInformation includes a container that FHIR does not.
* Added a comment to `deceased[x]`: When exporting the data, if `deceasedDateTime` (DateOfDeath) is present and has a value, DeathIndicator may be set to 'true', since DeathIndicator and DateOfDeath cannot both be represented at the same time.

## zib-Problem
* ProblemType has been added on a slice of `Condition.category` allowing the category element to be used for other purposes too.
* FurtherSpecificationProblemName has been added with an extension on `Condition.code`.
* `Condition.bodySite` is now based on the zib AnatomicalLocation profile.
* ProblemStartDate and ProblemEndDate are placed on a DateTime type slice of `Condition.onset[x]` and `Condition.abatement[x]` allowing the option to use other types.
* `Condition.note` now honours the max cardinality of zib Comment.
* `Condition.verificationStatus` contains a mandatory `.coding` element to capture the zib terminology because of the required binding on the CodeableConcept level and the zib and FHIR ValueSet do not completely map.

## Procedure
* Renamed profiles from zib-Procedure and zib-ProcedureRequest to zib-Procedure-event and zib-Procedure-request conform profiling guidelines.
* ProcedureStartDate and ProcedureEndDate have been mapped to `Procedure.performed[x]` instead of `Procedure.performedPeriod` to account for the use of `Procedure.performedDateTime` when the zib Procedure concerns a instantaneous procedure.
* Aligned cardinality of ProcedureMethod by setting the 'procedure-method' to 0..* instead of 0..0.
* The ProcedureAnatomicalLocation is mapped on `Procedure.bodySite` and the cadinality has been set to 0..1 instead of 0..*.
* The resource ProcedureRequest has been renamed to ServiceRequest and now includes a mapping for all the possible concepts of zib Procedure. Compared to STU3 a mapping has been added for ProcedureMethod, ProcedureAnatomicalLocation, MedicalDevice, ProcedureStartDate and ProcedureEndDate.
* `Procedure.location` and `ServiceRequest.locationReference` are used to reference the zib HealthcareProvider instead of `Procedure.performer` and `ProcedureRequest.performer` to indicate where the Procedure takes place.
* The `Procedure.performer` only references the zib HealthProfessional represented in a PractitionerRole resource. Other references not dictated by the zib are removed.
* `ServiceRequest.performer` contains a reference to the zib CareTeam because the FHIR definition deviates from the zib Performer concept when multiple references are provided. This is described in the element's comment.

## zib-Range
* There is no profile for this partial zib because the relevant parts can be modelled directly in the profiles where this zib is used.

## zib-TimeInterval
* In the previous release, the concepts of this partial zib were mapped directly in the profiles where they are used. In this release the usage of this partial zib has been expanded and profiles have been created to aid the usage in profiles in the various situations that might occur.

## zib-TextResult
* New concept VisualResult mapped in additional profile zib-TextResult.VisualResult on `Media.content`. `DiagnosticReport.image.link` references this profile.

# zib-TobaccoUse
* StartDate and EndDate are placed on a type slice of `Observation.effective[x]` adhering to the open world modelling principle.
* TobaccoUseStatus is placed on a type slice of `Observation.value[x]` adhering to the open world modelling principle.
* The comment element is moved to `Observation.note.text` instead of `Observation.comment`
* The datatype for PackYears has been changed from Quantity to integer to align with the functional definition and the Quantity datatype does not bring additional benefits to justify not aligning with the zib.

## zib-Vaccination
* Renamed profiles names: zib-Vaccination to zib-Vaccination-event and zib-VaccinationRecommendation to zib-Vaccination-request conform new profiling guidelines.
* Removed references not accounted for by the zib (e.g. `Immunization.location`, `Immunization.manufacturer` and `ImmunizationRecommendation.recommendation.supportingImmunization`).
* Aligned cardinality of `Immunization.note` with the zib by making it 0..1.
* Moved VaccinationDate on a type slice on `Immunization.occurrence[x]:occurrenceDateTime`. This element has been renamed from `date` to `occurence[x]` in R4.
* Moved Administrator to a slice on `Immunization.performer` with a mandatory fixed pattern in `Immunization.performer.function`.
* Added a pattern on `Immunization.doseQuantity` to mandate the use of mL by ucum because the definition of Dose states to use milliliters. 
* Removed orderStatus extension because PlannedCareActivityForTransfer zib does not exist anymore.
* Aligned cardinalities of ImmunizationRecommendation with the zib by constraining them and documentend this on the root element.
* Removed mapping of DesiredDateForRevaccination because it has been removed by the zib as well. The DesiredDateForRevaccination concept has been replaced by mapping to VaccinationDate which is placed on `ImmunizationRecommendation.recommendation.dateCriterion.value`. The mapping to PlannedCareActivityForTransfer start and end dates have been removed from this element.
